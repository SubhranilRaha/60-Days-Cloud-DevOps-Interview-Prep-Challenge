## Key Outcomes

This session was a structured revision day covering Days 1–4 of the program curriculum, encompassing AWS fundamentals, cloud computing models, DevOps principles, and the CI/CD pipeline flow. Participants engaged in live Q&A, real-world use case discussions, and mock interview questions. The instructor confirmed no special agenda beyond comprehensive revision, emphasizing that the program roadmap progresses from Linux → AWS → DevOps → Docker/Shell Scripting. Several participants introduced themselves, sharing backgrounds ranging from freshers to 10+ year professionals across development, QA, platform engineering, and full-stack domains.

## Session Structure & Ground Rules

- **Thumb rule enforced throughout:** All participants to remain on mute; press spacebar to unmute when speaking; raise hand to be called upon. 
- **Camera requirement:** All attendees requested to be on camera — rationale given that interviews are conducted on camera, so practice being visible builds confidence. 
- **Question discipline:** Participants instructed not to throw questions at the start of the session; type name in chat box to signal readiness; Q&A slots allocated every 10–15 minutes. 
- **Recording policy:** Session recording belongs to participants; may be revisited after 3, 6, or 12 months; background noise degrades recording quality, hence the mute rule. 
- **Recording access:** Same LMS link used for live class becomes the recording link approximately 90 minutes after session completion. 
- **Note-taking encouraged:** Re-watching recordings costs an additional hour; taking notes during the session is more efficient; all definitions already provided in written form on the platform.

## AWS Fundamentals

### What AWS Is

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** is a subsidiary of Amazon (the parent organization); provides cloud computing resources, virtualization resources, and data center services accessible via `aws.amazon.com`. 
- Core value proposition: provides servers, services, and resources on the cloud — accessible **on demand**, scalable very easily based on need. 
- AWS is described as no longer merely a cloud platform — it is the **foundational infrastructure** behind streaming apps, banking systems, AI products, e-commerce applications, and startups; billions of people depend on it daily. 
- Example: Recordings on the instructor's LMS are served from **S3**; if AWS S3 goes down, recordings become inaccessible — illustrating AWS as a basic necessity. 

### AWS History & Evolution

- Platform launched in **2002** at `aws.amazon.com/console`. 
- Early services included **SQS, EC2, VPC**; initial adoption was slow due to security concerns. 
- Timeline of key milestones: 
    - **2006:** EC2 machine available; security questions raised by market
    - **2007:** Security validation period
    - **2009:** VPC rolled out — users could create private networks and place resources securely within them
    - **2012:** Major customer event
    - **2016:** $10 billion revenue generated
    - **2017:** ~100 services launched; yearly releases accelerating
- Currently AWS offers **200+ services**; learning all of them is neither practical nor necessary. 
- **Recommended focus:** ~10 core services covering compute, networking, storage, database, and application/administrator activities — sufficient for real-world project use across 2–4 years of experience. 

### Market Share & Cloud Landscape

- AWS holds approximately **40% market share**; Azure approximately **30%**; GCP approximately **30%** (instructor noted data may be from ~2022). 
- **Google Cloud** consumption rate is increasing rapidly (~26% growth rate); may challenge top position within 2–5 years, driven by Kubernetes and AI services. 
- **Key insight:** All major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) offer equivalent services — only the names differ; knowing one cloud deeply enables working across all.  Confirmed by participant Kishor who migrated from AWS to Oracle Cloud (OCI) and found concepts identical. 
- Instructor committed to one dedicated session comparing **top 10 services across AWS, Azure, and GCP**. 

### Traditional Infrastructure vs. Cloud

- Historical evolution used as context: floppy disks (1.2 MB) → CDs/DVDs → pen drives → Google Drive (cloud storage) → **EBS/EFS** (AWS equivalents). 
- On-premises data center rooms (with SAN/storage area networks using FTP protocol) have been replaced by cloud services like EC2 and AMIs. 
- Physical networking (LAN cables, routers) is being replaced by air fiber and soon **satellite networks** (Starlink/SpaceX already operational on ships and cruise lines). 
- Physical access control (fingerprint systems) replaced by **IAM** (Identity and Access Management) in the cloud. 
- Conclusion: Traditional infrastructure components have cloud equivalents; the underlying logic and service categories remain the same, just delivered remotely.

## Cloud Computing Models

### Service Models (IaaS / PaaS / SaaS)

Explained using a pizza/kitchen/flat analogy: 

- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Ready-to-eat pizza — user manages nothing; application, data, runtime, middleware all managed by the cloud provider; examples: Gmail, Google Drive.  User just consumes the service.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Kitchen provided — platform (runtime, middleware, Docker) is provided; user brings their own application and data; example: Canva provides the platform, user brings their own presentation content. 
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Empty flat/room — network, storage, servers, virtualization, and OS provided; user installs everything else (middleware, runtime, application); example: taking an EC2 instance and building on top of it. 

### Cloud Deployment Types

- **Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud** — mentioned as the three deployment models. 

### Serverless Computing

- Defined as **"five-star service"** — user brings only code; no need to manage web servers, databases, networking, or security; billing is based on execution (pay-as-you-go). 
- AWS serverless service: **Lambda**. 
- **Lambda use cases discussed:**
    - Weekly scheduled activity (e.g., backups) — no need to run a 24/7 VM for a once-a-week task. 
    - Email shooting via **SQS queue trigger**: emails placed in SQS → Lambda triggered on each entry → processes SMTP and sends email to user (real example shared by participant Pravin). 
    - File format conversion: if resumes are submitted in CSV or Word format, Lambda converts them to PDF automatically, triggered once per week. 
- **Event-driven nature:** Lambda runs based on events or need — not continuously; this is the core distinction from always-on compute. 
- **Cost consideration:** Serverless is comparatively expensive (like a five-star hotel) — best suited for infrequent, event-based tasks rather than continuous workloads. 
- **Continuous vs. event-based guidance:** For regular, continuous database usage → use **RDS** (PaaS); for once-a-week or event-based processing → use **Lambda** (serverless). 

### Extended Service Model Taxonomy

Beyond IaaS/PaaS/SaaS, additional categories discussed for senior-level understanding: 

- **FaaS (Function as a Service):** Lambda; event-driven, short-duration functions
- **CaaS (Container as a Service):** Docker and Kubernetes-related activities — recommended for those targeting higher salary packages
- **DaaS (Database as a Service):** Managed database services
- **STaaS (Storage as a Service):** Managed storage
- **CaaS (Compute as a Service):** Compute resources as a service
- Instructor note: IaaS/PaaS/SaaS sufficient for up to ~10 LPA packages; CaaS and FaaS knowledge needed for higher compensation targets.

## DevOps Principles & Roles

### What DevOps Is

- DevOps automates the build, compilation, testing, and deployment pipeline so that software can be delivered continuously and with high quality. 
- Compared to **Waterfall model** (rigid sequential phases: design → code → test → deploy over 6 months, no ability to go back) — Waterfall has largely failed in modern software delivery. 
- **Agile model:** Iterative and incremental; deployments every 2 weeks; same 6-month duration produces ~9 versions vs. Waterfall's 1. 
- **DevOps with Continuous Deployment:** Designing, coding, and testing happen with automation; deployments occur daily; product quality significantly higher than other models. 

### The 6 Cs of DevOps

Explained as a continuous loop where **tools may change but the process remains constant**: 

1. **Continuous Business Planning** — ongoing feature and roadmap discussions between business stakeholders
2. **Continuous Integration (CI)** — developers write code locally → push to Git/Bitbucket via pull request → Jenkins picks up code via trigger → compiles and builds → feedback sent to developer automatically
3. **Continuous Testing** — test scripts (e.g., Selenium) scheduled in Jenkins to run multiple times per day; continuous execution of test cases
4. **Continuous Delivery** — code deployed to environments after **manual approval** (e.g., a button click or pipeline-level approval gate before production); used by ~95% of companies
5. **Continuous Deployment** — fully automated deployment with no human approval step; used by ~5% of companies (instructor advised not to claim this in interviews unless accurate) 
6. **Continuous Monitoring** — monitoring set up across all environments; alerts and logs fed back into the cycle
- **Delivery vs. Deployment distinction (critical for interviews):** Delivery requires a manual approval before production deployment; deployment is fully automated with no human gate. 
- **DevSecOps extension:** Security can be added as **Continuous Security** within the 6C framework, covering both cloud security and infrastructure (e.g., firewall configuration). 

### DevOps Pipeline Flow (Participant-Explained)

Participant Pankaj walked through a real pipeline: 

- Developer writes code in local IDE → raises **Pull Request** → approved and merged into Git/Bitbucket
- **Jenkins** picks up code via webhook or SCM trigger → builds → runs testing (Selenium)
- Jenkins triggers build/test cycle → **Docker image** created → **manifest file** generated
- Deployed to **Kubernetes**
- **Terraform** used to provision full infrastructure for Kubernetes environments
- Logging, errors, and feedback loop back to developers automatically

### DevOps Job Roles

Multiple profiles discussed as valid career targets within the DevOps ecosystem: 

- DevOps Engineer
- Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)
- Cloud Operations Engineer
- Cloud Engineer
- Infrastructure Engineer
- Platform Engineer
- DevSecOps Engineer (requires security knowledge)
- Release Engineer / Build Engineer
- AIOps
- System Administrator (foundational to all above roles)

### Skills Required for DevOps Engineers

- **System administration excellence** is mandatory — must be proficient in Linux and Windows server management, performance tuning, and environment handling. 
- **Networking and storage knowledge** required. 
- **Coding/scripting:** Full coding not required, but at least basic understanding and prompt engineering capability; automation via Python and Shell scripting. 
- **Effective communication:** Must be able to explain issues to operations teams, developers, and management; must be "explainable." 
- **Cloud management and orchestration:** Docker and Kubernetes knowledge opens senior profiles. 
- **Real-world system thinking example:** If a production server's CPU/memory hits 90% (like Zoom consuming resources in the session), you cannot simply kill the process — you must increase compute, optimize the application, or work with developers to reduce resource consumption; same logic applies to laptops and servers. 

---

## Tools & Technology Discussed

- **Jenkins:** Primary CI tool; used for integration, build automation, scheduling test scripts, and deployment pipelines; can also handle deployment but may be paired with other tools like Octopus for specific deployment features. 
- **Octopus Deploy:** Used alongside Jenkins in some organizations for deployment; instructor explained that each tool has limitations and teams may prefer specialized tools for specific stages. 
- **Terraform:** Used for full infrastructure provisioning, especially in Kubernetes environments. 
- **Docker & Kubernetes:** Core to CaaS; Kubernetes handles automatic rollback; GKE is Google's managed Kubernetes service. 
- **SonarQube:** Mentioned in context of integrating code quality checks into Jenkins pipelines (DevSecOps project reference). 
- **GitHub / Bitbucket / GitLab:** Source control platforms; Jenkins integrates via webhook or SCM trigger. 
- **AWS Lambda:** Serverless compute; configured by cloud engineers; has a dedicated full session planned. 
- **AWS SQS:** Queue service; used as event trigger for Lambda (email processing use case). 
- **AWS EC2:** Virtual machine service; front-end and middleware hosting for web applications. 
- **AWS RDS:** Managed relational database service; recommended for continuous database needs. 
- **AWS S3:** Object storage; used for resume/file storage and media delivery. 
- **AWS VPC:** Private network for securing EC2 and other resources. 
- **AWS IAM:** Identity and Access Management; replaced physical access control systems. 
- **Multiple monitoring tools:** Organizations often run more than one monitoring tool simultaneously because no single tool satisfies all requirements.

## Mock Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: What is AWS?

- Best answer framework: AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon providing cloud computing resources (servers, storage, networking, databases) accessible on demand via `aws.amazon.com`; it is the foundation behind streaming, banking, AI, and e-commerce at global scale. 

### Q: If a developer pushes code to GitHub but Jenkins does not start the build, what do you check?

Answers provided by participants Mandhir and Pawan: 

- **Authentication issue** between Jenkins and GitHub (most common; private repos require credentials)
- **Plugin configuration** — required Jenkins plugins may be missing or misconfigured
- **Webhook/trigger configuration** — webhook may not be set up correctly
- **Timezone mismatch** — if Jenkins is scheduled and running on UK time zone while team monitors in India time zone, builds may appear to not trigger at expected times

### Q: How do you roll back a deployment?

- **Versioning approach:** Tag each build with a version (V1, V2, V3, V4); if V4 fails, re-trigger the Jenkins pipeline pointing to the stable V3 build. 
- **Kubernetes:** Handles rollback automatically.
- Simple answer: change the version reference in the pipeline and re-run.

### Q: Linux server is running out of disk space — what do you do?

- First step: Check disk usage with `df -h` (disk free) and `du -sh` (disk usage by directory). 
- Check swap partition utilization
- If application partition is full, inspect logs under `/var/log`
- Options: clean up unnecessary logs/files, add/extend a partition, increase storage size 

### Q: What AWS service best fits building a web application (e.g., a job portal with messaging, resume upload, certification storage)?

- **Front-end:** EC2
- **Middleware/business logic:** EC2
- **Database:** RDS
- **File/resume storage:** S3
- **Networking:** VPC 

### Q: PaaS vs. Serverless — what is the difference?

- **PaaS:** Underlying infrastructure (compute, OS, runtime) is provided and visible; you deploy Docker/Kubernetes or other services on top; CPU/memory allocation is known and managed. 
- **Serverless:** No underlying infrastructure management; service is ready to use; bring only code or data; scales automatically on event trigger; billed per execution. 
- **Practical rule:** Continuous/regular workloads → PaaS (RDS for databases); infrequent/event-based → Serverless (Lambda). 

### Q: How can a non-AWS user pitch AWS experience in an interview?

- Instructor guidance: Even without direct AWS tool usage, understanding the concepts and being able to map them to your project context is valid; Linux and system admin knowledge is universally applicable.

# Part 2: 20 Scenario-Based Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. Developer pushed code to GitHub, but Jenkins didn't start. What will you check?
**Answer:**
- GitHub-Jenkins authentication
- Webhook configuration
- Jenkins job trigger configuration
- Required Jenkins plugins
- Jenkins logs
- Repository permissions

## 2. Your production deployment failed. How will you roll back?
**Answer:** Use versioned builds. If V4 failed, redeploy the last stable V3 build through the pipeline. In Kubernetes, use the deployment rollback mechanism.

## 3. Linux server is running out of disk space. What will you do?
**Answer:** First check disk usage:
```bash
df -h
du -sh *
```
Then identify large files/directories, check `/var/log`, clean unnecessary data, or increase storage/partition if required.

## 4. You need to build a job portal on AWS. Which services would you use?
**Answer:**
- EC2 → application/frontend
- RDS → relational database
- S3 → resumes/files
- VPC → networking and security

## 5. You need to process an email whenever a message enters a queue. What would you use?
**Answer:** Use **SQS + Lambda**. SQS receives the message and Lambda is triggered to process it.

## 6. You have a task that runs only once every week. Would you use EC2 24/7?
**Answer:** Not necessarily. Consider **Lambda with a scheduled trigger** because an always-running EC2 instance may not be required for an occasional task.

## 7. Users upload files in different formats and you need to convert them to PDF automatically. What would you use?
**Answer:** Store the uploaded files in **S3** and trigger **Lambda** to perform the conversion when the required event occurs.

## 8. Your application needs a database that is continuously used by users. Lambda or RDS?
**Answer:** For a continuously used relational database, choose **RDS**. Lambda is better suited to event-driven or short-duration processing.

## 9. Your application CPU reaches 90% in production. What will you do?
**Answer:** Identify the reason using monitoring and system-level investigation. Depending on the root cause, scale infrastructure, optimize the application, or work with developers to reduce resource consumption.

## 10. Your Jenkins pipeline builds successfully but the application is not deployed. What will you check?
**Answer:**
- Deployment stage logs
- Target server/Kubernetes connectivity
- Credentials
- Deployment configuration
- Environment variables
- Docker image availability
- Deployment permissions

## 11. Your Docker image works locally but fails in another environment. What will you investigate?
**Answer:** Check whether the image contains all required dependencies, environment variables, configuration files, exposed ports, and correct application versions. Compare the runtime environments.

## 12. Your Kubernetes application is running but users cannot access it. What would you check?
**Answer:**
1. Pod status
2. Service
3. Service endpoints
4. Ingress configuration
5. Application logs
6. Network/security rules
7. Container port vs service port

## 13. Terraform creates the infrastructure but the application cannot connect to the database. What will you check?
**Answer:** Check VPC/network configuration, security rules, database endpoint, ports, credentials, subnet placement, and whether the application is using the correct database endpoint.

## 14. Your AWS application needs to store resumes uploaded by users. Which service would you choose?
**Answer:** Use **S3** because it is designed for object/file storage. Store the object reference in the database if required.

## 15. You need to control which users can access an S3 bucket. What would you use?
**Answer:** Use **IAM permissions and roles**, along with appropriate S3 bucket policies, to control access.

## 16. Your company wants developers to receive automatic feedback whenever they push code. How would you implement it?
**Answer:** Configure a CI pipeline where GitHub triggers Jenkins. Jenkins builds the application, runs tests, and sends the build/test result back to the team.

## 17. Your production deployment should require manager approval before deployment. Which approach would you use?
**Answer:** Implement **Continuous Delivery** with a manual approval gate before production deployment.

## 18. Management wants every successful code change deployed automatically to production. What approach is this?
**Answer:** This is **Continuous Deployment**, where deployment happens automatically after the required build and testing stages without a manual approval step.

## 19. Your AWS bill suddenly increases. What will you check first?
**Answer:** Check active resources and their usage, identify unexpected resources or workloads, review billing details, and configure a **budget alarm** to receive alerts when spending crosses the defined threshold.

## 20. Explain a complete DevOps pipeline for a real project.
**Answer:**
A typical flow is:

**Developer → Git/PR → Jenkins → Build → Testing → Docker Image → Kubernetes → Monitoring → Feedback**

Terraform can be used to provision the infrastructure required for the Kubernetes environment.

# Quick Interview Tip

For scenario questions, don't just name a tool. Explain:

**Problem → Investigation → Tool → Action → Expected Result**

Example:

> "First I will identify the issue from logs and monitoring. Then I will check the relevant configuration and connectivity. After finding the root cause, I will fix it and validate the application again."

This approach makes the answer more practical and interview-friendly.
